In response to forecast shortfalls for the domestic market in\n2018-19, the Australian Government signed an agreement with three major LNG exporters to offer sufficient gas\nto the domestic market. In 2017, the Australian Government implemented the Australian Domestic Gas Security\nMechanism to ensure a sufficient supply of natural gas to meet the forecast needs of Australian consumers.

                    "Energy: The largest sectoral increase in greenhouse gas emissions over the 1990 to 2015 period, of\n84.4 Mt CO₂-e (42.7 per cent), occurred in the stationary energy sector, driven in part by increasing\npopulation, household incomes and export increases from the resource sector. Within the stationary\nenergy sector, electricity generation emissions have fallen from a peak in 2009 due to a combination of\nlower electricity demand and changes in the fuel mix used to generate electricity. The main drivers for the\nincrease in transport emissions are continuing growth in the number of passenger vehicles, along with an\nincrease in diesel consumption in heavy vehicles. Fugitive emissions have increased largely due to increased\nproduction from open cut coal mines and increased gas production.\n• Industrial processes and product use: The increase in emissions since 1990 is primarily driven by the\ngrowth in emissions associated with hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and chemical industries.\nAgriculture: The decrease in emissions since 1990 is primarily associated with a decline in sheep numbers.\nOffsetting these decreases has been an increase in cattle numbers. Overall, net agriculture emissions\ndeclined 12.7 per cent.\n• Waste: The net emissions from waste have decreased as increases associated with growing populations an\nindustrial production have been offset by increased methane recovery.\nLULUCF: The decreasing trend in emissions from LULUCF since 1990 has been mainly driven by the decline\nin emissions from land clearing (forest land converted to cropland and grassland)."

These measures will deliver an estimated $7 billion in economic benefits and\nreduce emissions by 45 MtCO -e (cumulative to 2030).\nExpansion of the Commercial Building Disclosure program: requires most sellers and lessors of large office\nspaces to provide energy efficiency information to prospective buyers and tenants. From 1 July 2017 the\nmandatory disclosure threshold for buildings size was lowered from 2,000 square metres to 1,000 square\nmetres. This will lead to an estimated $50 million in new energy savings, and about 3.5 MtCO₂-e reduction,\ncalculated on a five year program duration, between the years of 2015 and 2019.\nImproved energy efficiency of residential buildings: targeted industry training and tools are being\ndelivered to improve compliance with the energy performance requirements of the Australian National\nConstruction Code, and ensure residential buildings are built to need less energy for heating and cooling.\nRobust energy use data: the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is\ncreating an Energy Use Data Model to understand Australians' energy consumption and influencing factors\nsuch as a change in climate, exponential growth in use of solar electricity, and increasing energy efficiency."

                    "The CarbonNet Project (CarbonNet) is investigating the potential for a commercial scale CCS network in\nthe Gippsland region of Victoria. The network could integrate multiple carbon dioxide capture projects\nin the Latrobe Valley, transporting carbon dioxide via a common-use pipeline and injecting it deep\nbeneath the Gippsland Basin to be securely stored within suitable geological formations. If proved\nviable, CarbonNet could enable innovative new industries in Gippsland securing jobs, boosting skills and\nattracting investment while strengthening Victoria's energy security.\n• The Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies Otway research facility is Australia's\nfirst demonstration of the deep geological storage of carbon dioxide. The project provides technical\ninformation on the injection, storage and monitoring of carbon. This information will influence national\npolicy and industry while providing assurance to the community. The facility demonstrates that carbon\ncapture and storage is safe, cost-effective and meets the expectations of government and the community.\nThe CCS Research Development and Demonstration Fund provides funding for carbon capture and\nstorage projects with a particular focus on transport and storage. It supports the Australian Government's\ncommitment to reduce the technical and commercial barriers to the deployment of large-scale\nCCS projects.\nThe Australian Government contributed funding and support for an industry-led Roadmap for Carbon\nCapture and Storage for Australia. The Roadmap was released in February 2017 and highlights CCS is an\nessential component of Australia's energy mix, to ensure energy security and affordability while meeting\nfuture emissions reductions targets at low cost. It is required in the power sector and will also play a vital\nrole in decarbonising industrial processes, such as cement and steel production.\nThe National Geosequestration Laboratory delivers innovative research solutions to support Australia's\ncarbon storage, energy and resources industries. For example, it is the lead research partner for the South\nWest Hub CCS project in Western Australia.\nThe Australian Government has introduced to Parliament proposed changes to the Clean Energy Finance\nCorporation Act 2012 to allow the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to invest in CCS."

By 2025, the price of electric vehicles is\nexpected to decline, reaching parity with traditional internal combustion engines vehicles.

Low local sea levels primarily associated with the 2015-16 El Niño\nand unusually hot and dry conditions likely provided a stressful environment for the mangroves.

As part of COP21 in Paris 2015, developed\ncountries were urged to scale-up their level of support and provide a 'concrete roadmap' to achieve the\nUSD100 billion goal. Australia, with the United Kingdom, led developed countries to deliver this Roadmap.\nThe Roadmap aims to provide increased predictability and transparency about how the goal will be\nreached, and sets out the range of actions developed countries will take to meet it. Drawing on analysis\nby the OECD, the Roadmap shows developed countries are well-placed to meet the USD100 billion goal,\nthrough a combination of public and mobilised private finance. Australia is committed to doing its part\nto meet the USD100 billion goal, and to support the broader transformation of finance flows needed to\nimplement the Paris Agreement."

This finance flows to developing country partners through targeted bilateral\nand multilateral climate investments. Mainstreaming climate considerations in the aid program allows better\nidentification of, and support for climate related needs and opportunities. Australia's climate finance contributes\nto the collective global effort to provide and mobilise USD100 billion by 2020. In 2015, the OECD, in collaboration\nwith the Climate Policy Initiative, prepared a report on climate finance. The report estimated the aggregate\nvolume of public and private climate finance mobilised by developed countries for developing countries reached\nUSD62 billion in 2014, up from USD52 billion in 2013.\""

The Partnership brings together governments, non-government organisations and research\ninstitutes who are working to enhance the protection and restoration of coastal blue carbon ecosystems -\nmangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses. When degraded or lost, blue carbon ecosystems can become significant\nemission sources. Protection and restoration of these ecosystems can contribute to climate change mitigation,\nincrease coastal resilience and protection from storm surges, and deliver a range of co-benefits for food security,\nfisheries and sustainable livelihoods. In November 2017, the Australian Government announced a AUD6 million\ninitiative to support efforts to protect and manage coastal blue carbon ecosystems in the Pacific. This initiative will\naim to strengthen blue carbon expertise and data in the Pacific, support its integration into national greenhouse\ngas accounting and climate policy, and encourage public and private sector investment. Australia has also\nsupported a blue carbon workshop for Coral Triangle Initiative countries and will provide the Government's\npeak scientific body - CSIRO - with close to AUDO.5 million to take forward blue carbon initiatives in the Indian\nOcean region. This work has been supported by an Australia Awards Fellowships program to build capacity on\nmanaging the blue economy, with a particular focus on Blue Carbon, for fellows from Madagascar, Mauritius and\nthe Seychelles."

In May 2017, the\nCentre for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research (CSHOR) opened within the CSIRO Climate Science Centre.\nCSHOR focuses on the role of the Southern Hemisphere oceans in the global climate. The CSHOR is a collaboration\nbetween CSIRO, China's Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, with support from\nthe University of Tasmania and the University of New South Wales. CSHOR's research includes a new initiative\nlaunched in 2016 to develop and test a decadal forecasting system. With 10 years of committed funding\n($37 million) and 15 research staff, the project will consider the processes influencing multi-annual to decadal\nclimate variability in the Australasian region. The results of this project will support decision-makers across\nnumerous industry sectors (e.g. agriculture, energy, water, health, financial and insurance sectors) to manage the\nrisks and opportunities arising from decadal variations in climate."

Researchers in NSW have shown that under high greenhouse\ngas emissions, there could be 20 per cent fewer winter-time east coast lows by the end of the century. Climate\nchange may affect the intensity, frequency and duration of east coast lows with implications for coastal erosion,\ninundation, flooding, and water security. The NSW Government's Eastern Seaboard Climate Change Initiative\ninvestigated past, recent and future east coast lows and their effects on rainfall, coastal processes and water\nsecurity in southeast Australia. Climate modelling based on the NSW and ACT Regional Climate Modelling\nProjections indicate a decrease in the number of small to moderate east coast lows in the cool season with little\nchange in these storms during the warm season. However, extreme east coast lows in the warmer months may\nincrease in number but extreme east coast lows in cool seasons may not change. The Eastern Seaboard Climate\nChange Initiative found that there are several types of east coast lows, and this affects the storm's impacts, and\nthat clustering of storms may be more important than individual storms."

Further climate change impact assessments are underway.\nFor example, the NSW government has built on this work to assess climate change impacts, such as\nimpacts on water availability, bushfire, biodiversity and habitat, soil erosion and agriculture, in NSW\nalpine areas.\nThe Victorian Climate Initiative (2013-2016) was a regional research initiative to improve understanding\nof past climate variability and change, seasonal climate prediction, and future climate and the associated\nrisks to water resources. Data on climate variability, predictability, and change is being used to improve\npredictions of water availability in the short term (seasonal to inter-annual timescales). The data will\nunderpin an improved assessment of the risks to water supplies from changes in climate over the mediu\nto longer term.\nSince 2010, Tasmania has applied downscaled climate projections to planning and decision making. The\nprojections were developed by the Climate Futures for Tasmania project. This project was undertaken by\nACE CRC with funding from the Tasmanian Government and other parties.\n• In 2016, the Queensland Government released downscaled climate change projections providing high\nresolution data for Queensland's regions at a 10 km grid for 11 climate models (See High Resolution\nClimate Change Projection Data for Queensland).\n• In 2015, South Australia released SA Climate Ready which represents the most comprehensive set of\ndownscaled climate projections data available for South Australia. Data is available through to 2100 for a\nnumber of climate variables including rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature and evaporation, fo\neach of the state's individual rainfall stations."

Australia's approach to\ncounting emissions and removals from the LULUCF sector is set out in CTF Table 2(d). Emissions and removals for\neach LULUCF sub-classification are estimated applying methodologies and activity definitions from the IPCC's\n2013 Revised Supplementary Methods and Good Practice Guidance Arising from the Kyoto Protocol. The concordance\nbetween UNFCCC LULUCF classifications and KP LULUCF classifications used by Australia is given in Table 4.2 in\nsection 4.2.1. In aggregate there is little difference in the trend estimates between the KP LULUCF and UNFCCC\nLULUCF inventories. In practice, the most significant difference is in the scope of forest lands. Under the KP\nclassifications, Australia uses a narrow approach to Forest Management that restricts the inclusion of forests to\nthose lands where forests are managed for timber production. Under the UNFCCC classification system all forest\nlands are included. Further detail on Australia's approach to land sector reporting and coverage is provided in\nsection 4.2.1 of this Biennial Report."

We are working with the Government of Kiribati to\nprovide safe and healthy learning environments, adequate resources, a modern curriculum, professional\nteachers, and improved management of the education system. Climate change considerations - both\nadaptation and mitigation - have been explicitly built into the initiative. These include employing climate-\nsensitive design and engineering measures such as raising floor heights, and using solar power where ever\npossible. Of Australia's $12 million investment in KEIP during 2014-15 and 2015-16, a total of $3.6 million\nhas been accounted as contributing to Australia's climate finance."
