          "Green consumption is the consumption behavior of various consumer entities that implement green and low-carbon concepts in the entire process of consumption activities. In recent years, my country has made positive progress in promoting green consumption, and the concept of green consumption has gradually become popular. However, the demand for green consumption still needs to be stimulated and released. Waste and unreasonable consumption still exist in some areas. The long-term mechanism for promoting green consumption still needs to be improved. Green consumption The supporting role in high-quality economic development needs to be further improved. Promoting green consumption is a profound change in the field of consumption. Green concepts must be deeply integrated into the entire cycle, chain, and system of all areas of consumption, and comprehensively promote the green and low-carbon transformation and upgrading of consumption. This is important for implementing new development concepts, building a new development pattern, and promoting High-quality development and achieving the goal of carbon peak and carbon neutrality play an important role and are of great significance. This plan is formulated in accordance with the relevant requirements of the &quot;Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Completely, Accurately and Comprehensively Implementing the New Development Concept and Doing a Good Job in Carbon Neutrality to Peak Carbon&quot; and the &quot;Action Plan for Carbon Peaking Before 2030&quot;. 1.
