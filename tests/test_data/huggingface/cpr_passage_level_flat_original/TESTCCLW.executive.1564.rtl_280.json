With this end, the EPP fixes measurable targets, for example: increase the percentage of renewable energy sources to 15% by 2020 and to 20% by 2030; boost the share of biofuels in the transport fuels market to 10%; and building of at least one biogas agricultural plant in each commune by 2020.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The EPP 2030 strategy document establishes the need to gradually increase the share of bio-components fuel in transport fuels so as to meet planned objectives.

The road towards achievement of the common EU targets can be covered in a variety of ways, depending on the national capacities and background and the new circumstances that could not be foreseen in advance. The review of EPP2040 will aim at selecting the optimum national path within the new geopolitical and economic framework and with consideration to the protection of consumers against excessive increase in the energy prices and deepening of the energy poverty."
