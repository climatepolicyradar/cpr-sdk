Spain has the opportunity to position itself as a technological reference in the production and use of renewable hydrogen, leading a country project towards a decarbonized economy, through the promotion of the hydrogen value chain through the creation of technological clusters and pilot projects on a regional scale. , the promotion of industrial innovation, support for just transition zones and the availability of renewable energy at competitive prices."

All of this with the ultimate objective of contributing to the achievement of the objectives set in the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan. In particular, Vision 2030 foresees an installed electrolyzer capacity of 4 GW and a series of milestones in the industrial sector, mobility and the electricity sector, for which it will be necessary to mobilize investments estimated at 8.9 billion euros during the period 2020- 2030. However, as an intermediate milestone until reaching the 4GW objective, it is estimated that by 2024 it would be possible to have an installed electrolyzer power of between 300 and 600 MW."
